1) Write the differences between Web3.js and Ether.js?
Ans) Web3.ja and Ether.js are both Ethereum Javascript libraries.
  Web3.js:
           It is developed and maintained by the Ethereum foudation.
One of the major difference between web3.js and ether.js is how they handle key management and interaction with the Ethereum Blockchain.
  Web3.js assumes that there is a local node connected to application. It assumed that node to store keys,sign tractions and reads and interacts with the 
   Ethereum blockchain.
 Ether.js:
          It is developed and maintained by Rick Moore-A Developer.
 In Ether.js seperates the node into two seperate roles.
* A wallet that holds keys and signs transactions
* A provider that serves as an anonymous connection to the Ethereum network, checking state and sending transactions.
